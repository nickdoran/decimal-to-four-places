# What this program Is

This program is a CLI that rounds numbers to the nearest 4th decimal place. It is a very simple program. You run the main file and type in/paste your number into the terminal input, then hit ENTER. After, the terminal will display your new number and also copy it to your clipboard.

# Why did I make this program?

During one of my STT 200 assignments, I found that I was rounding my numbers to the 4th decimal place, and I wanted to create a program that did this for me rather than counting 4 places and rounding it myself. I wanted to try to automate a simple task into program that could do it for me.
